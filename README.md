This is a small HTML program I wrote to help myself with certain text manipulation tasks. It was made entirely to address my own complaints about a website I used to use for the same tasks.

The whole tool is contained in one file so you never have to wait while a website is performing maintenance. There are no character limits. You can chain effects together with the 'add' button.

Considering making a sort of module system for complex behavior like the shader tools in Blender.
